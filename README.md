# Scientific Inquiry Project Template

Welcome to your collaborative scientific inquiry project! This repository provides a structured template to guide you through a semester-long scientific research project using GitHub's collaborative tools.

## Purpose

This template is designed to:
- Teach you the scientific method through hands-on practice
- Introduce you to professional collaborative workflows using GitHub
- Provide a clear structure for organizing your research
- Foster peer review and constructive feedback
- Document your entire research process transparently

```

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account (or clone it if your instructor provides a copy).
2. **Explore the directories** to understand the project phases.
3. **Start with the Issues tab** – you'll find a checklist of milestones you need to complete.

## Project Workflow

This project is organized into five distinct phases, each represented by a directory and tracked using GitHub Issues.

1. **Planning (`01_proposal`)** – Define your research question, hypothesis, and methodology.
2. **Data Collection (`02_data`)** – Gather and document your raw data.
3. **Analysis (`03_analysis`)** – Clean, process, and analyze your data.
4. **Results (`04_results`)** – Generate figures, tables, and other outputs.
5. **Final Report (`05_final_report`)** – Write up your findings and conclusions.

### How to Progress Through Phases

Each phase corresponds to a GitHub Issue. You will:
- Read the issue description and instructions.
- Complete the required work in the appropriate directory.
- Create a branch for your changes.
- Submit a Pull Request to merge your work.
- Link the Pull Request to the issue (e.g., "Closes #2").
- Request review from your instructor and peers.

## Submission and Peer Review

**Never commit directly to the `main` branch.** Follow this process for each major milestone:

1. **Create a new branch** from `main` (e.g., `feature/proposal`, `feature/data-analysis`).
2. **Make your changes** on that branch (edit the appropriate files).
3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to merge your branch into `main`.
4. **In the PR description**, link to the corresponding Issue (e.g., "Closes #4") and describe the changes you made.
5. **Assign reviewers** – add your instructor and peer reviewers to the PR for feedback.
6. **Incorporate feedback** – address comments and suggestions before merging.

This process simulates real‑world scientific peer review, teaching you how to give and receive constructive criticism on your scientific work and methods.

## Tips for Success

- **Commit often** with clear, descriptive messages.
- **Use the Issues** to track your progress and ask questions.
- **Review your peers' work** thoughtfully – good feedback helps everyone improve.
- **Keep your data and analysis reproducible** by documenting every step.
- **Have fun and be curious!** Science is about exploration and discovery.

## Need Help?

- Consult your instructor for project‑specific guidance.
- Refer to GitHub's own documentation for [Git basics](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git) and [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).
- Search online for scientific‑writing resources or coding help relevant to your analysis.
