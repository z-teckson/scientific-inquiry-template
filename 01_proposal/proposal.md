# Research Proposal Template

Complete this document to outline your research project. This proposal will serve as your plan for the semester.

## 1. Research Question

*State the central question your project aims to answer. Make it clear, specific, and measurable.*

**Example:** How does the concentration of salt in water affect the growth rate of duckweed (Lemna minor) over a 14‑day period?

**Your Question:**



## 2. Background & Rationale

*Briefly explain why this question is interesting or important. Cite any relevant prior knowledge or observations.*

**Example:** Freshwater ecosystems are increasingly affected by salt pollution from road de‑icing and agricultural runoff. Understanding how primary producers like duckweed respond to salt stress can inform water‑quality management.

**Your Background:**



## 3. Hypothesis

*Formulate a testable prediction. It should be a clear statement that can be supported or refuted by your data.*

**Example:** Increasing salt concentration will decrease the growth rate of duckweed, with concentrations above 5 g/L leading to negligible growth.

**Your Hypothesis:**



## 4. Variables

*Identify the independent, dependent, and controlled variables.*

| Variable Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Independent** | *What you will change on purpose* |
| **Dependent**   | *What you will measure* |
| **Controlled**  | *What you will keep constant* |

**Your Variables:**
- Independent:
- Dependent:
- Controlled (list at least three):



## 5. Materials & Methods

*Describe the equipment, supplies, and step‑by‑step procedure you will follow. Include enough detail that someone else could repeat your experiment.*

**Example:**
- **Materials:** 20 duckweed fronds, 5 plastic containers, sodium chloride, distilled water, digital scale, graduated cylinder, ruler, camera, data‑logging software.
- **Procedure:**
  1. Prepare five salt solutions (0 g/L, 2 g/L, 5 g/L, 10 g/L, 15 g/L).
  2. Place four duckweed fronds in each container with 500 mL of the corresponding solution.
  3. Position all containers under identical light and temperature conditions.
  4. Measure the total frond area daily for 14 days using image analysis.
  5. Record observations of frond color, root length, and any mortality.

**Your Materials & Methods:**



## 6. Data Collection Plan

*How will you record your data? What units will you use? Will you collect replicates?*

**Example:** Data will be recorded in a spreadsheet with columns for Date, Salt Concentration (g/L), Replicate Number, Frond Area (mm²), and Notes. Three replicates per concentration will be used.

**Your Data Collection Plan:**



## 7. Timeline

*Estimate how long each phase of the project will take. Refer to the overall semester schedule.*

| Week | Tasks |
|------|-------|
| 1–2 | Finalize proposal, gather materials |
| 3–5 | Conduct experiment, collect data |
| 6–7 | Clean and analyze data |
| 8–9 | Interpret results, create figures |
| 10–12 | Write final report, peer review |

**Your Adjusted Timeline:**



## 8. Ethical & Safety Considerations

*Are there any ethical concerns (e.g., human subjects, animal welfare) or safety precautions (chemicals, electrical equipment) you need to address?*

**Example:** Sodium chloride is a mild irritant; gloves and safety glasses will be worn when handling concentrated salt. No vertebrate animals are used.

**Your Considerations:**
